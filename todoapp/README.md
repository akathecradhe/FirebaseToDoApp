# To-Do-Application 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Latest Release: https://jovial-marigold-6e1a08.netlify.app/

Github Address: https://github.com/akathecradhe/FirebaseToDoApp


 ## Task

    You are to build a simple todo-list React app using redux. This project will require you to build a front-end user interface as you see fit that will allow you to do the following functions:
    -Add a new item to the list
    -Delete an item from the list
    -Update an existing item
 
    This project will also be connected to a firebase backend. This will require setting up a firebase project and linking the React frontend to a firestore database. There will be a save button that will save the items in the database. These saved items would then be loaded in from the database when opening the React application. Please upload this to a public github repo that we would be able to view and download from for testing.
