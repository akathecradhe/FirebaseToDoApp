Latest Release: https://jovial-marigold-6e1a08.netlify.app/

Github Address: https://github.com/akathecradhe/FirebaseToDoApp


    ##task

    You are to build a simple todo-list React app using redux. This project will require you to build a front-end user interface as you see fit that will allow you to do the following functions:
    Add a new item to the list
    Delete an item from the list
    Update an existing item
 
    This project will also be connected to a firebase backend. This will require setting up a firebase project and linking the React frontend to a firestore database. There will be a save button that will save the items in the database. These saved items would then be loaded in from the database when opening the React application. Please upload this to a public github repo that we would be able to view and download from for testing.

    
    #User Stories 

    1: As a user I want to Add items to my to-do list so that i can keep a track of all the things i need to complete

    2: As a user I want to Remove items from my to-do list so that I  have a record of only things that I need to do

    3: As a user I want to Update existing items in my to-do list incase any thing changes with the task or I have made a mistake

    4: As a user I want the list of to-do items to be saved so that when I close the app and return to it I can still see the same items
